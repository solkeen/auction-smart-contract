## Features

### - As the Creator of Auction
The NFTs will be stored in the auction address.
When the `admin` creates an auction, call the `create_open_auction` function, the NFT will be sent to the PDA and the data of this auction is stored on blockchain.
```js
pub fn create_open_auction(
        ctx: Context<CreateOpenAuction>,
        bump: u8,
        title: String,
        floor: u64,
        increment: u64,
        start_time: u64,
        end_time: u64,
        bidder_cap: u64,
        token_amount: u64,
    )
```

The creator can reclaim NFT from the PDA if nobody buys tickets and the time exceeds the endTime of auction. 
```js
pub fn reclaim_item_open(ctx: Context<ReclaimItemOpen>)
```

The creator can withdraw the winning bid from the PDA.
```js
pub fn withdraw_winning_bid_open(ctx: Context<WithdrawWinningBidOpen>)
```
